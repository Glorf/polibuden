Your projects are now void.
I am not responsible for lost ECTS, angry lecturers, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because you got accused of stealing the project. Please do some research if you have any concerns about files included in this repo before using it! YOU are choosing to use these files, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your education, I will laugh at you. A lot.
